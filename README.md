## Overview
  
### The Challenge

- Build a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. You must use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library to work with date and time. 
  
### Acceptance Criteria

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

* Uses a date utility library to work with date and time

* Application deployed at live URL

* Application loads with no errors

* Application GitHub URL submitted

* GitHub repo contains application code

* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate

* Application user interface style is clean and polished

* The application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the homework instructions

* The following mock-up animation demonstrates the application functionality (a user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events):
